# LendingClub-Loan-Prediction
Predict whether a customer will likely default or not using supervised learning models with Lending Club Loan data.

It explored various different possible models: a Logistic Regression Model, a Random Forest Model, a K Nearest Neighbor Model, a Support Vector Machine Model and a Neural Network Model. The models are fitted using the scikit learn library and their results are compared together to find the best model as well as the most significant features.

All details of the project is contained in main.py and the jupyter notebook file, the used dataset is included here in loan-clean-version.csv
